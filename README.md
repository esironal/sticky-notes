Sticky Notes
============

Sticky Notes is an app written in HTML, using JavaScript, localStorage and CSS3. I used sprite for the images, and it looks like a work board where you can attach notes and move it in the board, also edit the text, and erase the note. It works with localStorage to save the data in a local way, but if you want to work in another machine you can export your data, it's going to be saved in MongoLab and the app brings you a code, after you can import the data in your machine bringing your code, and the data is going to be loaded, and you can continue working in a local way using localStorage.

* This demo uses a modified version of Bootstrap to load quickly, thanks to Twitter Bootstrap.
* Also it uses a font with a Open License, thanks to Angel Koziupa and Alejandro Paul.
